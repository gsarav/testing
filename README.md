Our web application will serve as a platform designed to spotlight and connect students with small businesses operating on campus. Enhancing accessibility, our application empowers students to seamlessly explore and engage with the diverse offerings at UMD that could just be a 5 minute walk away. Beyond promoting lesser-known businesses, it also serves as a gateway for students to discover affordable solutions to meet their needs.
